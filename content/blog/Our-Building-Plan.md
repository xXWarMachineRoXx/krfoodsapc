# K R FOOD APC: Transforming Food Processing in Haryana

## Introduction
K R FOOD APC, promoted by the State of Haryana, aims to establish Mini Food Parks or Agro Processing Clusters. The primary objective is to enhance the food processing infrastructure along the entire value chain, from the farm to the market. The initiative facilitates compliance with environmental and safety standards for food processing units.

## Tackling Food Wastage
Addressing the significant issue of food wastage, particularly in perishable segments like fruits and vegetables, the Mini Food Park emphasizes proper handling during storage and transportation. With unsuitable environmental conditions contributing to losses, the initiative seeks to mitigate wastage and enhance remuneration for producers. 

## Rising Wastage Trends
Despite India's substantial food production, wastage increased notably between 2010 and 2019 in segments such as milk, poultry, meat, fisheries, fruits, and vegetables. The establishment of adequate processing facilities is crucial in curbing this trend, ensuring better returns for producers, and meeting consumer demand.

## Growth Potential in Haryana
The food processing sector in Haryana holds significant investment appeal and offers substantial growth potential. This is in line with the tactical advantages outlined in World Food India 2017. The strategic location and conducive environment make Haryana an attractive hub for the food processing industry.

## Government Support
K R Food APC aims to leverage the opportunities extended by the Government of India and the Government of Haryana to address infrastructure gaps in the food processing sector. Recognizing the basic need for Indian citizens to have sufficient, healthy, and affordable food, the initiative aligns with national objectives and contributes to the growth of the food processing industry in the state.
