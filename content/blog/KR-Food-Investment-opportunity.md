## Balanced Regional Development

The Mini Food Park scheme focuses on developing agro-processing clusters in the form of Mini-Food parks, promoting food processing industry near production areas, i.e., rural and backward regions¹. This approach supports the growth of backward regions and promotes balanced regional development¹.

## Infrastructure and Facilities

The scheme aims to develop capital intensive common facilities like cold storages, blast freezers, specialized packaging, IQF, warehousing, etc., which are required by food processing units¹. The availability of such modern infrastructure encourages entrepreneurs to set up more food processing units¹.

## Economic Impact

These mini food parks help in reducing the wastage of surplus produce and add value to the horticultural/agricultural produce¹. This results in an increase in the income of farmers and creates employment at the local level¹.

## Investment Details

At least 5 food processing units with an aggregate investment of minimum INR 15 crore will be set up in the Mini Food Park¹. These units can also be set up by the promoters/developers and by other entrepreneurs¹.

## Conclusion

Considering the modern infrastructure, balanced regional development, and the economic impact, KR Food's Mini Park emerges as a promising investment opportunity. It not only offers a profitable venture for investors but also contributes significantly to the local economy and the food processing industry.
