The Government of Haryana has formulated the Mini Food Park scheme as a part of Haryana Agri-business and Food Processing Policy 2018.

#### 1.2

#### 1.3
The state government shall focus on developing agro-processing clusters in the form of Mini-Food parks by promoting food processing industry near production areas i.e. rural and backward regions.

#### 1.4
The scheme aims at the development of modern infrastructure to encourage entrepreneurs to set up food processing units based on a cluster approach. These mini food parks will help in reducing the wastage of surplus produce and add value to the horticultural/agricultural produce.

#### 2.2
To provide integrated and complete preservation infrastructure facilities from the farm gate to the consumer.
